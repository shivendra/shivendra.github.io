I am Shivendra Singh, a full stack developer based in Pune, India. My interests are javascript, algorithms and scalability. I am a big time cricket fan and a die hard fan of M S Dhoni. I love to travel and intend on visisting all continents ( so far I have been to only 2). When not coding, I try my hand at squash, tennis and occassionally cricket.
